# Gus-nuig
Overall, this repository is a collection of codes I've written while at Nuig that I want to keep for the future.

Vowel-counter is a small program that takes a string input from the user and checks if it's alphabetical or  numerical. It then tells the user how many vowels and consonants the string has. 

In another version I modified it to also count numbers. It would be very simple to add a number of different functions to the code skeleton.
